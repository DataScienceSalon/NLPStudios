#' @section TextStudio Design:
#' This TextStudio family of classes is an implementation of the Strategy
#' design pattern, as described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
#' Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson
#' and John Vlissides (hence Gang of Four). The Strategy pattern defines
#' the family of text cleaning classes, encapsulates class and allows
#' text cleaning algorithms to be selected and exchagned at runtime.
